Try this.  This is modeling the output capacitor as two series capacitors, with the midpoint connected to the AC ground.  This is a very common technique.

Be careful of modeling the diodes too.  If the Is is not the right value, the effective gain will be too large and the simulation will not be stable.  Adding a small series resistance to the diode can help with that.
