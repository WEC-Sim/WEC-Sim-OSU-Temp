 Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have jointly developed WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter-SIMulator), an open-source wave energy converter (WEC) design tool capable of running on a standard personal computer. WEC-Sim  simulates WECs of arbitrary device geometry subject to operational waves \cite{wecsim}. The code is developed in MATLAB/Simulink using the multi-body dynamics solver SimMechanics, and relies on Boundary Element Method (BEM) codes to obtain hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass, radiation damping, and wave excitation. The WEC-Sim hydrodynamic solution has been verified through code-to-code comparison, and has undergone preliminary validation through comparison to experimental data \textbf{Kelley: add OMAE2014 refs and OMAE 2015 comp ref} \cite{yu2014design}\cite{lawson2014implementing} \cite{ruehl2014preliminary}\cite{ruehl2014development}.  
 Further validation of the WEC-Sim code will be performed upon completion of the WEC-Sim validation tank testing, scheduled for Summer 2015. 
 
-Version 1.0 of WEC-Sim, released in Summer 2014, models WECs as a combination of rigid bodies, joints, linear power take-offs (PTOs), and mooring systems. While the Version 1.0 release of the WEC-Sim code was limited to modeling PTOs as simple linear dampers, collaboration with the Energy Systems group at Oregon State University (OSU) has resulted in the development of PTO-Sim (Power Take Off-SIMulator). PTO-Sim is the WEC-Sim module responsible for accurately modeling a WECâ€™s conversion of mechanical power to electrical power through its PTO system (or power conversion chain, PCC). It consists of a library of PTO component blocks that can be linked together to model different PTO systems. Each of these PTO library blocks is a model of common PTO components, such as: electric generators, pistons, and accumulators. Two different applications of PTO-Sim will be given in this paper: a hydraulic power take-off system model, and  a linear direct drive power take-off system model.

-It should be noted that while future releases of WEC-Sim will include fully integrated applications of PTO-Sim coupled with WEC-Sim, the simulations shown in the paper are the result of independent PTO-Sim simulations (without WEC-Sim coupling). For purposes of describing PTO Sim operation, the WEC-Sim output (zDot) is the system input. The input is the same for both PTO architectures.

 The input power is from inside the hydraulics - so efficiency is not yet tied to absolute input power. In order words, the available power (absolute input power) is not the same as the absorbed power (Pabs). An irregular wave with a significant wave height of 3 meters and a dominant period of 11 seconds is used.

 \section*{DIRECT DRIVE PTO}
-Alternative to hydraulics, the direct drive power take off has less moving parts which allows a generator to capture power directly to the buoy movement. In this architecture, the PTO uses the direct wave motion to drive the generator. The stator portion of the generator is contained in the WEC spar, while the buoy contains the magnets. This is illustrated in Fig. 12 (Smithsonian). The buoy movement causes the magnetic field surrounding the coils to change, the fundamental method for generating electricity. While this architecture has fewer power transformation stages and moving parts, it also has no power storage capability.

 The governing equation for a direct drive PTO listed below. 
 \begin{equation}

+\noindent where $k = P/2$ for rotational generator and $k = \pi/\tau_{pm}$ for a linear generator.  The generator is modeled in the synchronous reference frame, where $\lambda_{sd}$ is the stator d-axis flux linkage, $i_{sq}$ is the stator q-axis current, $\lambda_{sq}$ is the stator q-axis flux linkage, and $i_{sd}$ is the stator d-axis current.  Derivation can be found from \cite{mohan2001advanced}.
 
-Equation (10) leads to (11), which describes the electromagnetic force. Derivation can be found from \cite{mohan2001advanced}.
+Assuming the d-axis is aligned with the stator flux such that $\lambda_{sq} = 0$, (10) leads to (11), which describes the electromagnetic force for a linear electric machine. 
 \begin{equation}
 F_{em}=(\pi/\tau_{pm})\lambda_{sd}i_{sq}
 \end{equation}
 
-The d-axis is assumed to be aligned with rotor magnets, so $\lambda_{fq} =0$. The electromagnetic force $F_{em}$ is the same as PTO force.

 \section*{Generated Power Comparisons}
 
-The usefulness of the PTO-Sim tool is exemplified by comparing the results from the two different architectures. The output electrical powers for each PTO architecture are normalized and plotted in Fig. 20. Normalization effectively removes the scaling of the results, allowing for a true comparison to be made. This figure clearly shows the native storage capability of the Hydraulic system, which manifests as a smoother power profile that can become negative. In contrast, the direct drive architecture results are very dynamic and always positive. 
-
-In addition, Fig. 20 shows that the hydraulic power is significantly lower than the direct drive due to the mechanical conversion stage.

 \section*{CONCLUSIONS}
 
-\textbf{Kelley: sloppy, needs more content}
-This paper demonstrates the development and application of PTO-Sim, the WEC-Sim module responsible for accurately modeling a WECâ€™s conversion of mechanical power to electrical power through its PTO system (or power conversion chain, PCC). While the initial release of WEC-Sim, Version 1.0, included the ability to model a WEC's PTO system as a simple linear damper, PTO-Sim allows users to model more complicated WEC PCCs. To demonstrate the functionality of PTO-Sim, two applications of PTO-Sim were shown in the paper, one of a hydraulic PTO system, and one of a direct drive PTO system. These two configurations were chosen because they reflect the two most common WEC PTO systems, for WECs of TRL 5+. Once fully coupled with  WEC-Sim, PTO-Sim will be released with future versions of the WEC-Sim code.

Once fully coupled with WEC-Sim, PTO-Sim will be released with future versions of the WEC-Sim code.
