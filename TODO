To Do List: Each person is responsible for updating their own tasks

SNL
	Kelley
		Create separate test case script for comparison (wait till *.m files are improved)
		Look into Simulink/SimMechanics linking with DLLs
		
	Sam
		Create PTO library of different PTO configs

NREL
	Mike
		add SWL or wave elevatopm to simulation
	Ye
		Consolidate wafo scripts and combine with SNL's Wave-Sim files (6/25/13)
		Write Wave-Sim memo demonstrating time-series and spectra generation
	Yi-Hsiang
		
	Adam
		Replace geometry transforms in *.slx with a *.m file for cg locations, connection points. etc.
		Clean up geometry subsystem in SimMechanics
		Clean up hydroforce subsystem in SimMechanics
		Compare WEC-Sim to experiments
		Compare WEC-Sim to WaveDyn

Other
	Algebraic loop issue
	Develop CPT and Oyster models in WEC-Sim
	Library of representative WEC bodies and joints
	Add inertia term for D-D drivetrain (hydraulics subystem breaks because of IF 	statements)
