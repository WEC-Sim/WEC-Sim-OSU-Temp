WEC-Sim Tutorials
==================
This section describes how to use the WEC-Sim code to model two different WECs.  The first application models a two-body point absorber WEC, and the second application models an OSWEC. The files corresponding to these two examples are included in the applications directory of the WEC-Sim source code.

RM3 Two-Body Point Absorber
----------------------------

3.1.1 Geometry Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first application of the WEC-Sim code is the Reference Model 3 (RM3) two-body point absorber design. Although the WEC is free to move in all 6DOF in response to wave motion, power is captured only in the relative heave direction. The RM3 device was selected because the design has already been well characterized both numerically and experimentally as a result of the DOE-funded Reference Model Project, more information on this project available on the  `Reference Model website <http://energy.sandia.gov/rmp>`_. In addition, the device has relatively simple operating principles and is representative of designs WEC industry is currently pursuing. RM3 is a simple two-body point absorber, consisting of a float and a reaction plate. The full-scale dimensions of the RM3 and its mass properties are are shown below.

Hydrodynamic Data Pre-Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The hydrodynamic data for each body must be supplied in `bemio` hydrodynamic data format generated using the `bemio <http://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/>`_ code. The hydrodynamic data for each body can be supplied in one single ''hdf5'' file, or several (ie. one per body). In this application case, a single file is provided. This file was created based on a WAIMT run of the RM3 geometry, using the WAMIT output file and the WAMIT reader from the  bemio. The WAMIT ``*.out`` file and the python `bemio` script used to create the `hdf5` are included as well. All these files are located in the ``/hydroData`` directory of the RM3 application case.

Modeling RM3 in WEC-Sim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this section,   a step by step tutorial on how to set up and run the RM3 simulation in WEC-Sim is provided. 

All WEC-Sim models consist of a input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``), and a Simulink model file (``RM3.slx``). To run the WEC-Sim simulation, the user needs to provide results from the frequency-domain BEM solver, to populate the WEC-Sim hydrodynamic coefficients. These results must be provided in the form of one or several  ``*.h5`` file(s) as described in Section 3.1.2. The user also needs to specify the 3-D geometry file for each body  in the form of a ``*.stl`` file with the origin of the coordinate system at the center of gravity. this is used for the WEC-Sim visualization. For the RM3 run consisting of a buoy and a spar plate, these files correspond to the ``float.stl`` and ``plate.stl`` files respectively. The RM3 ``*.stl`` files are located in the ''/geometry'' directory. Additionally users have the option of supplying a ``userDefinedFunctions.m`` file for post-processing immediately after the WEC-Sim run is complete. In summary, the files needed to run a WEC-Sim case are the following:

* Input file: ``wecSimInputFile.m``
* Simulink model: ``rm3.slx``
* Geometry file for each body: ``float.stl`` and ``plate.stl``
* Hydrodynamic data file(s): ``rm3.h5`` 
* Optional user defined postprocessing file: ``userDefinedFunctions.m``

Simulink Model
....................

The first step to initiate a WEC-Sim simulation is to create the Simulink model file by dragging and dropping blocks from the WEC-Sim library into the ``rm3.slx`` file. 

* Step 1: Place two ``Rigid Body`` blocks from the WEC-Sim library in the Simulink model file, one for each RM3 rigid body, as shown in the figure below. 

.. figure:: _static/RM3_WECSim_Body.jpg
   :width: 400pt


* Step 2: Double click on the ``Rigid Body`` block, and rename the instances of the body. The first body should be titled 'body(1)', and the second body should be titled ``'body(2)'``. Additional properties of these body blocks are defined in the following RM3 MATLAB input file.


* Step 3: Place the ``Global Reference Frame`` from the WEC-Sim library in the Simulink model file, as shown in the figure below. The global reference frame acts as the seabed to which all other bodies are linked through joints or constraints.

.. figure:: _static/RM3_WECSim_GlobalRef.jpg
   :width: 400pt


* Step 4: Use the ``Floating constraint`` block to connect the plate to the seabed. This is done because the RM3 is free to move relative to the global reference frame. Step 4 and 5 connections are shown in the figure below. 


* Step 5: Place a ``Translational PTO (Local Z)`` block to connect the float to the spar. This is necessary because the float is restricted to heave motion relative to the plate. For the RM3 simulation, the translational PTO block is used to model the WEC's PTO as a linear damper. The parameters are defined in the RM3 MATLAB input file.

When setting up a WEC-Sim model, it is important to note the base and follower frames. For example, for the constraint between the plate and the reference frame should be the base because the plate moves relative to it.  Similarly, for the PTO between the float and the plate, the plate should be defined as the base and the float as the follower.

Input File
.................

In this section, we define the WEC-Sim MATLAB input file for the RM3 model. Each of the lines are commented to explain the purpose of the defined parameters. For the RM3 model, the user must define the simulation parameters, body properties, PTO, and constraint definitions. The specified input parameters for RM3 are shown in the figure below.

Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the WEC-Sim Simulink model is set up and the RM3 properties are defined in the MATLAB input file, the user can then run the RM3 model in WEC-Sim by running the ``wecSim`` command from the MATLAB Command Window. The figure below shows the final RM3 Simulink model and the WEC-Sim GUI during the simulation.

Outputs and Postprocessing
.................................

This example has a ``userDefinedFunctions.m`` which plots different forces and responses. The user is encouraged to modify this file. Additionally, after the WEC-Sim run is done, the user has access to the ``output`` variable in the workspace which contains all the simulation outputs.

Running Different Wave Cases
.................................

The input file in the RM3 example has four different wave examples: 
* Regular waves
* Irregular waves with using Piersonâ€“Moskowitz spectrum with convolution integral calculation
* Irregular waves with using Bretschneider Spectrum with state space calculation
* Irregular waves with defined spectrum, and irregular waves with a user defined spectrum

By default the regular waves case is used. To run either of the other three cases the user needs to comment out the regular wave case and uncomment the desired case. Additionally, the user can create any other desired wave. 

Note: If ``simu.ssCalc=1`` is uncommented, the user needs to make sure the the state space hydrodynamic coefficients are included in the ``<hydro-data name>.hd5`` file. User can generate the state space hydrodynamic coefficients and export the values in the ``<hydro-data name>.hd5`` file using the bemio code. More details are discribed in the `Calculating Impulse Response Functions and Sate Space Coefficients <http://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/api.html#calculating-impulse-response-functions-and-sate-space-coefficients>`_ section in the `bemio` Documentation and Users Guide

Oscillating Surge-Pitch Device
--------------------------------

Geometry Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the second application of the WEC-Sim code, the oscillating surge WEC (OSWEC) device. We selected the OSWEC because its design is fundamentally different from the RM3. This is critical because WECs span an extensive design space, and it is important to model devices in WEC-Sim that operate under different principles.  The OSWEC is fixed to the ground and has a flap that is connected through a hinge to the base that restricts the flap to pitch about the hinge. The full-scale dimensions of the OSWEC and the mass properties are shown in the figure and table below.

Hydrodynamic Data Pre-Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hydrodynamic data for each body must be supplied in `bemio` hydrodynamic data format generated using the `bemio`_ code.  More information on how to use `bemio` can be found here - http://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/. The hydrodynamic data for each body can be supplied in one single ''hdf5'' file, or several (ie. one per body). In this application case, a single file is provided. This file was created based on a WAIMT run of the RM3 geometry, using the WAMIT output file and the WAMIT reader from the  `bemio open source BEM parser <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio/releases>`_ . The WAMIT ``*.out`` file and the python bemio script used to create the ''hdf5'' are included as well. All these files are located in the ''/hydroData'' directory of the RM3 application case.

Modeling OSWEC in WEC-Sim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we provide a step by step tutorial on how to set up and run the OSWEC simulation in WEC-Sim. 

All WEC-Sim models consist of a input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``), and a Simulink model file (``OSWEC.slx``). The BEM hydrodynamic results were also pregenerated using WAMIT. The WAMIT output file corresponds to the ``oswec.out`` file, contained in the wamit subfolder. In addition, the user needs to specify the 3-D geometry file in the form of a ``<WEC model name>.stl`` file about the center of gravity for the WEC-Sim visualizations. For the OSWEC run consisting of a flap and a base, these files correspond to the ``flap.stl`` and ``base.stl`` files, respectively, which are located in the geometry subfolder.

OSWEC Simulink Model File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step to set up a WEC-Sim simulation is to populate the Simulink model file by dragging and dropping blocks from the WEC-Sim library into the ``<WEC model name>.slx`` file. 

* Step 1: Place two ``Rigid Body`` blocks from the WEC-Sim library in the Simulink model file, one for each OSWEC rigid body, as shown in the figure below. 

.. figure::: _static/OSWEC_WECSim_Body.jpg
   :width: 400pt


* Step 2: Double click on the body block, and rename the instances of the body. The first body should be titled body(1), and the second body should be titled body(2). Additional properties of these body blocks are defined in the OSWEC MATLAB input file.


* Step 3: Place the ``Global Reference`` block from the WEC-Sim library in the Simulink model file, as shown in the figure below. The global reference frame acts as the base to which all other bodies are linked through joints or constraints.

.. figure::: _static/OSWEC_WECSim_GlobalRef.jpg


* Step 4: Place a ``Fixed constraint`` block to connect the base to the seafloor. This is done because the OSWEC base is fixed relative to the global reference frame. Step 4 and 5 connections are shown in the figure below.


* Step 5: Place a ``Rotational PTO`` block to connect the base to the flap. This is done because the flap is restricted to pitch motion relative to the base.  For the OSWEC simulation, the ``Rotational PTO`` is used to model the WEC's PTO as a linear rotary damper. The input parameters are defined in the OSWEC MATLAB input file. 

.. figure::: _static/OSWEC_WECSim.JPG
   :width: 400pt


When setting up a WEC-Sim model, it is important to note the base and follower frames. For example, for the constraint between the base and the seabed, the seabed should be defined as the base because it is the Global Reference Frame.

OSWEC MATLAB Input File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this section, the WEC-Sim MATLAB input file, ``wecSimInputFile.m``, for the OSWEC model is defined. Each of the lines are commented to explain the purpose of the defined parameters. For the OSWEC model, the user must define the simulation parameters, body properties, PTO, and constraint definitions. Each of the specified parameters for OSWEC are defined below.

OSWEC WEC-Sim Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the WEC-Sim Simulink model is set up and the OSWEC properties are defined in the MATLAB input file, the user can then run the OSWEC model in WEC-Sim by running the ``wecSim`` command from the MATLAB Command Window..  The figure below shows the final OSWEC Simulink model and the WEC-Sim GUI showing the OSWEC during the simulation.
